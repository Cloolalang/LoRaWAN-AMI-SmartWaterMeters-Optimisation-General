Questions for End-device vendors;

For the end-device to operate for the planned life-cycle;
1) What is the EIRP of the device in normal operation as measured by a lab/radiated emmision test? (its <the max allowed, why?)
2) What is the near-field clearance area around the device in which no obstruction should exist in the installation which could effect the antenna performance?
3) What is the maximum spreading factor and number of repititions to be used in normal operation?
4) What is the maximum payload size and number of UL packets per day in normal operation?
5) What is the number of DL packets that the device can recieve and process per day?
6) Is fuota used in the device and if so, how oftern can it be used?
7) Describe the join process and back-off cycle for failed join attempts including the spreading factors and power levels used during join.
